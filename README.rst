The PyR3 package serves two purposes:
    - provides blender in form of python package (bpy)
    - contains useful shortcuts and abstractions over bpy API

**This software is completely free to use: is released under MIT license.**


Installation
============
PyR3 is available on Python Package Index and can be installed automatically with **pip**::

    pip install PyR3

You can also install the in-development version from github with::

    pip install https://github.com/Argmaster/pyr3/archive/main.zip


Side Effects
============

Using this package has side effects that the user should be aware of.
Side effects will occurs after PyR3 is imported (PyR3.__init__ is run).

See Side Effects on Installation page for more in-depth description.

Because we often want those side effects to be guaranteed to happen,
I encourage you to instead of simply importing bpy, use following

.. code-block:: python

    from PyR3.bpy import bpy

It will cause PyR3.__init__ to be always invoked before you request bpy.

Documentation
=============

Documentation is available on-line at https://pyr3.readthedocs.io/

You can also build documentation yourself using tox::

    git clone hhttps://github.com/Argmaster/pyr3.git
    cd PyR3
    tox -e docs
